    <h1>Top 5 Most Venomous Spiders</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Funnel Web Spider (Atrax spp.)</strong> - The Sydney Funnel Web spider, which includes Atrax robustus and Atrax seladonia, is known for its highly toxic venom. Its bite can cause severe and potentially fatal symptoms, but bites are rare due to the availability of antivenom.</li>
        <li><strong> Wandering Spider (Phoneutria spp.)</strong> - Brazilian wandering spiders, also known as "wandering spiders," possess highly potent venom. Their bite can result in intense pain, excessive sweating, nausea, and other serious side effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Recluse Spider (Loxosceles spp.)</strong> - The bite of a brown recluse spider can lead to skin necrosis and systemic complications in some cases. While not as lethal as some other spiders, its venom can be dangerous.</li>
        <li><strong>Sack Spider (Loxosceles spp.)</strong> - Sack spiders are close relatives of brown recluses and can also cause significant tissue damage at the bite site.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Black Widow (Latrodectus spp.)</strong> - While most black widow bites are not fatal, the venom of this spider can be quite painful and lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, muscle spasms, and other adverse effects in humans.</li>
    </ol>
